Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves structuring the layout with HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding functionality with JavaScript. Here's a high-level overview of each component:

HTML (Structure)
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of the calculator.
It includes elements like buttons for digits (0-9), operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a display area to show the input and result, and other controls like clear and equal buttons.
The HTML might consist of a <div> for the display and several <button> elements for each calculator key.

CSS (Styling)
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements.
This involves setting the size, colors, fonts, and positioning of the buttons and display.
Flexbox or Grid layout is often used to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.
CSS classes and IDs are used to apply specific styles to individual elements or groups of elements.

JavaScript (Functionality)
JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to the calculator.
It captures user input (button clicks), processes the input (e.g., performing calculations), and updates the display.
Functions are created to handle different operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), clear the display, and compute the result when the equals button is pressed.
Event listeners are used to detect button clicks and execute corresponding functions.

Putting It All Together
The HTML file links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
The calculator functionality is encapsulated in JavaScript functions, and the layout is carefully designed in HTML and CSS to ensure a good user experience.

Example of a Flow:
HTML: Structure the layout using divs and buttons.
CSS: Style the layout to make it look like a calculator.
JavaScript: Add logic to handle user input and perform calculations.
